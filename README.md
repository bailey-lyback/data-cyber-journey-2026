# 🔐 Data & Cyber Journey 2026  
### Security-first. Data-enabled. Career-focused.

This repository documents my 2026 learning and project journey as I strengthen my skills in **cybersecurity**, **network defense**, and **data-driven security analysis**.  
It brings together my SNHU coursework, Coursera specializations, Python development environment, SQL practice, and hands-on projects that support my long-term goal of becoming a professional in **defensive cybersecurity operations**.

---

## 🧭 Mission for 2026

Build a strong, employer-ready foundation in:

- Cyber defense and network security  
- Operating system security  
- Defensive security tools and workflows  
- Python scripting for automation and analysis  
- Data analysis for incident response, logging, and detection engineering  
- SQL for querying, validation, auditing, and reporting  
- Secure application principles  
- Modern analytics platforms (Excel, Power BI, Tableau)  

My priority is **security**, supported heavily by **data analytics**, which is essential for threat detection, monitoring, and decision-making.
